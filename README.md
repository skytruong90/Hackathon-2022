# Hackaton 2022:

## This is my project that I made in this year Hackathon.

Please check it out and explore the application. 

Problem:

A researcher at South Georgia Medical Center has contracted you to design an app for his research study. In his research of patient-doctor interactions, he has noticed a trend that patients struggle to accurately report their current condition. This results in doctors prescribing more medication than needed. Patients in pain may report around a 9 on the pain scale, but find the pain is relatively tolerable. Drowsy patients may misreport their drowsiness. He would like you to create an application that helps users accurately report their conditions and keep track of their responses.

Preliminary Information:

Pain Scale:

1 - pain is barely noticeable

5 - pain is very distracting and may stop them from being able to do typical activities

10 - pain is bad enough to prevent moving on your own

Instructions:

You have been contracted to develop an application that will keep track of patientsâ€™ conditions as they report them. The application should also help the user create accurate reports. You can do this by giving examples, explanations, as well as anything else that you can come up with!

The researcher is asking for the following types of reports

Pain reporting

Drowsiness reporting

Mental health condition reporting

They would like the following information collected along with the submitted reports

Name

Age

The researcher would also like you to include a way to export reports to a file, so they can run the numbers through an external resource for statistical analysis. Additionally, include some clinically proven psychological tips and tricks that can also help a patient manage their own tolerance levels.

Minimum Viable Product:

Reporting on one of the desired types (pain, drowsiness, or mental health).

Explains different levels to the user or the person that the user is assisting.

Collect reports from the patients.
